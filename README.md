## Inspiration Behind the Project
The inspiration for this project comes from the growing need to speed up AI computations, especially in the field of image classification. AlexNet, a pioneering deep learning model for image classification, revolutionized the field by winning the 2012 ImageNet competition. However, performing the computationally expensive convolution operations at scale can be time-consuming and power-hungry on conventional hardware. We sought to explore how FPGA acceleration could enhance the speed and efficiency of these operations.
